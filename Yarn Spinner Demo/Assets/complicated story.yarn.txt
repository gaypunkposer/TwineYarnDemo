<<set $monster to "an even bigger rock with even better clothes">>You find a sturdy stick and the sharp looking rock. You ask the rock for fashion advice and where it got those snazzy clothes. The rock does not respond.

[[This is unacceptable. Destroy the rock.|Dead]]
[[Put the rock down. You will find your own style, eventually.|Fire]]
[[Turn the rock into a weapon. Poison your enemies with its sick threads.|Weapon]]
